# Decide whether you are an NRI or Not

In India, whether you‚Äôre treated as a **Resident** or **Non-Resident (NRI)** is decided by the **Income Tax Act (Section 6)**, based on **days of physical stay in India during a financial year (April‚ÄìMarch)**.

---

## üß≠ Basic Rule for Non-Resident Status

A person is considered **Resident in India** if they satisfy **any one** of these conditions:

1. Stayed in India **182 days or more** during the financial year, **OR**
2. Stayed in India **60 days or more** during the financial year **AND** 365 days or more in the **last 4 preceding financial years**.

üëâ If **neither condition is satisfied**, the person becomes a **Non-Resident** for that year.

---

## ‚úàÔ∏è Relaxation for Indians Leaving or Returning

For **Indian citizens** or **Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)** who leave India for:

* **Employment abroad**, or
* **As crew of an Indian ship**,

üëâ the **60-day condition is extended to 182 days**.
So, such individuals are considered **Resident** only if they stayed **182 days or more** in that year.

This helps people working abroad qualify as **Non-Residents** more easily.

---

## üìä Example Scenarios

1. **Worked abroad entire year, visited India for 150 days**

   * Less than 182 days ‚Üí **Non-Resident**.

2. **Visited India for 200 days**

   * More than 182 days ‚Üí **Resident** (even if abroad otherwise).

3. **Stayed 100 days in India in FY, but also 400 days in last 4 years**

   * Satisfies condition (2) ‚Üí **Resident**, unless leaving for employment (then only 182-day test applies).

---

## üßæ Special Categories

* **Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR)**: Transitional category if you recently moved abroad and haven‚Äôt been a non-resident for long.
* **Deemed Residency**: From FY 2020-21, Indian citizens with **global income > ‚Çπ15 lakh** and **not taxable in any other country** are deemed Residents in India (but usually RNOR).

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
A person becomes a **Non-Resident Indian (NRI)** for tax purposes if they **stay in India for less than 182 days in a financial year** (with some nuances if not leaving for employment).

# Account Type for NRIs

If you are living abroad and qualify as a **Non-Resident Indian (NRI)** under Indian tax rules, you are also required under **RBI (Reserve Bank of India) regulations** to change the status of your Indian bank accounts.

---

## üè¶ What Happens to Resident Accounts When You Become NRI

1. **Savings Account**

   * Your regular resident savings account **cannot be maintained once you become NRI**.
   * You must convert it to an **NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account**.
   * If you fail to do this, the account is legally non-compliant.

2. **Types of NRI Bank Accounts**

   * **NRO Account** (Non-Resident Ordinary)

     * For income earned in India (rent, pension, dividends, etc.).
     * Funds are repatriable (can be sent abroad) up to USD 1 million/year after tax compliance.
   * **NRE Account** (Non-Resident External)

     * For income earned abroad, held in INR.
     * Fully repatriable (principal + interest).
     * Interest is tax-free in India.
   * **FCNR Account** (Foreign Currency Non-Resident)

     * Fixed deposits in foreign currency.
     * No currency conversion risk, interest tax-free in India.

3. **Demat & Trading Accounts**

   * Resident demat/trading accounts must also be converted to **NRO demat** or **Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS)** accounts for NRIs.

---

## üìã How to Convert Your Account

* Notify your bank about your change of residency status.
* Submit:

  * Account conversion form
  * Copy of passport & visa/work permit
  * Overseas address proof
  * PAN card
* The bank will redesignate your resident savings account as **NRO/NRE**.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Why It Matters

* Keeping a resident account while being an NRI is a violation of **FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act)**.
* Penalties can be heavy if discovered during audits.
* RBI mandates compliance for all banks.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
Once you are a Non-Resident, you **must convert resident savings accounts into NRO/NRE/FCNR accounts**. You cannot legally operate a resident savings account while abroad.

---

## üìå Which One Should You Choose?

* **If you have income in India** (rent, pension, dividends, sale of property) ‚Üí **NRO Account**
* **If you want to park your overseas salary in India** and enjoy tax-free interest ‚Üí **NRE Account**

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Typical Combo for Retired/Working NRIs

* **NRO account** ‚Üí for Indian income inflows (pension, rent).
* **NRE account** ‚Üí for savings from abroad + easy repatriation.
* **FCNR account** ‚Üí for long-term deposits in foreign currency (good hedge against rupee depreciation).

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
Most NRIs maintain **both NRE + NRO accounts**:

* NRO for Indian earnings.
* NRE for foreign earnings and tax-free savings.
* FCNR is optional if you want to hold foreign currency deposits securely.

# ITR for NRI
In India, the **Income Tax Return (ITR) form** you must file as a **Non-Resident (NRI)** depends on the type of income you have in India (since only Indian-sourced income is taxable for NRIs).
